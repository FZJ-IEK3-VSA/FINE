Purpose
#######

ETHOS.FINE is a framework for generating energy system optimization models. 
ETHOS.FINE is designed to answer pressing questions on future energy systems such as affordability, 
a high share of renewable energy sources and low CO\ :sub:`2` emissions.
Its code is openly available on GitHub, allowing contributions and feedback from a wider modeling community. 

ETHOS.FINE offers a unique generic model setup with a high degree of freedom for model developers. 
Beyond energy system models, its generic implementation allows the modeling of all kinds of optimization problems, 
such as material flows and resource consumption or conversion as part of life cycle analysis. 
ETHOS.FINE was developed to provide a flexible techno-economic analysis tool to analyze the energy transition 
on all levels of interest especially with regards to sector-coupled systems.

ETHOS.FINE is designed to be used by researchers, students, and for teaching purposes in the field of energy systems modeling. 
In particular, its exceptional capabilities in terms of complexity reduction through (`Patil et al. (2022) <https://doi.org/10.3390/en15249517>`_) and temporal aggregation (`Hoffmann et al. (2020) <https://doi.org/10.3390/en13030641>`_, `Hoffmann et al. (2021) <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117825>`_, `Hoffmann et al. (2022) <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119029>`_), 
as well as heuristics for dealing with MILPs (`Kannengießer et al. (2019) <https://doi.org/10.3390/en12142825>`_, `Singh et al. (2022) <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11590-021-01826-w>`_ ) o
pen up a wide range of applications from small- to global-scale energy system models.
For newcomers who are not familiar with programming, there is also the flexibility 
of setting up models using Excel files, the usability of which is described in one of the example Jupyter notebooks 
published in the GitHub repository.

Once ETHOS.FINE is installed, you can start implementing an energy system model that you want to investigate.
