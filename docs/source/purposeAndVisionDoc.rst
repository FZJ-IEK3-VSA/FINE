FINE is a framework for generating energy system optimization models. This might sound difficult, but the puporse is easy to understand:
FINE is designed to answer pressing questions on future energy systems which include affordability, a high share of renewable energy sources and - most importantly - low CO\ :sub:`2` emissions.

The concept of FINE is that scientists, programmers and anyone who is interested all around the world can use FINE to answer their individual questions. Therefore, FINE is open source available and completely for free. Once FINE is installed, you can start implementing an energy system model that you want to investigate.
