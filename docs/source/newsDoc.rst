In FINE latest release (2.1) the following functionalities were included, for example: 
* New time series aggregation method: Segmentation of time series
* Bug Fix: TAC of transmission components within the optimization summary is fixed

In FINE latest release (2.0) the following functionalities were included, for example:

* Part load behavior (using piecewise linear functions (-> MILP))
* Robust discrete pipeline design under the consideration of pressure losses (see Robinius et al. (2019) https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10589-019-00085-x and Reuß et al. 2019 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360319919338625))
* A two-stage approach to reduce computation time of MILPs with time series aggregation, while providing a lower and upper error bound (Kanngießer et al. (2020) https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/14/2825)
* The option to model nonlinear investment cost functions (via a quadratic function, Lopion et al. (2019) https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/20/4006)
* A simple approach to model myopic foresight
* Ramping behavior of conversion components
* A beta version for modeling demand side management
