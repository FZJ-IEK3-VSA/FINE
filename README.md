# FINE - Framework for Integrated Energy System Assessment

The FINE python package provides a framework for modeling, optimizing and assessing energy systems. With the provided framework, systems with multiple regions, commodities and time steps can be modeled. Target of the optimization is the minimization of the total annual cost while considering technical and enviromental constraints. Besides using the full temporal resolution, an interconnected typical period storage formulation can be applied, that reduces the complexity and computational time of the model.

If you want to use FINE in a published work, please [**kindly cite following publication**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054421830879X) which gives a description of the first stages of the framework. The python package which provides the time series aggregation module and its corresponding literatur can be found [**here**](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/tsam).

## Features
* representation of an energy system by multiple locations, commodities and time steps
* complexity reducing storage formulation based on typical periods

## Documentation

A "Read the Docs" documentation of FINE can be found [**here**](https://vsa-fine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
## Requirements
### Framework
The FINE Framework itself requires the following components:
- FINE sourcecode
- Python dependencies
- A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver like Gurobi or GLPK
### Installation 
The installation proceedure requires:
- Git
- Anaconda
## Installation of framework and dependencies
### Installation requirements
1.  Install anaconda [by choosing your operating system here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). If you are a Windows 10 user, remember to tick "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" during installation under "Advanced installations options".
2. Install git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
### Prepare folder
1. Open a prompt e.g. "anaconda prompt" or "cmd" from the windows start menu
2. Make a folder where you want to work, for example C:\Users\<your username>\work with "mkdir C:\Users\<your username>\work"
3. Go to that directory with "cd C:\Users\<your username>\work" at the command line


### Get source code via GIT

Clone public repository or repository of your choice first
```
git clone https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/FINE.git 
```
Move into the FINE folder with
```
cd fine
```

### Installation for users
It is recommended to create a clean environment with conda to use FINE because it requires many dependencies. 

```
conda env create -f requirements.yml
```

This directly installs FINE and its dependencies in the `FINE` conda environment. Activate the created environment with:

```
activate FINE
```

### Installation for developers
Create a development environment if you want to modify it.
Install the requirements in a clean conda environment:
```
conda env create -f requirements_dev.yml
activate FINE_dev
```

This installs FINE and its requirements for development (testing, formatting). Further changes in the current folder are reflected in package installation through the installation with `pip -e`.

Run the test suite with:
```
pytest --cov=FINE test/
```

## Installation of an optimization solver

FINE requires an MILP solver which can be accessed using [PYOMO](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). There are three standard solvers defined:
- [GUROBI](http://www.gurobi.com/)
   - Recommended due to better performance but requires license (free academic version available)
   - Set as standard solver
- [GLPK](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winglpk/files/latest/download)
  - Free version available 
- [CBC](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc)
  - Free version available

### Gurobi installation
The installation requires the following three components:
- Gurobi Optimizer
    - In order to [download](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-optimizer-eula/) the software you need to create an account and obtain a license.
- Gurobi license
    - The license needs to be installed according to the instructions in the registration process.
- Gurobi python api
    - The python api can be installed according to [this instruction](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044290292-How-do-I-install-Gurobi-for-Python-).

### GLPK installation
A complete installation instruction for Windows can be found [here](http://winglpk.sourceforge.net/).

### CBC
Installation procedure can be found [here](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc).

## Examples

A number of [**examples**](examples/) shows the capabilities of FINE.

We are the <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/iek/iek-3">Institute of Energy and Climate Research - Techno-economic Systems Analysis (IEK-3)</a> belonging to the <a href="https://www.fz-juelich.de/en">Forschungszentrum Jülich</a>. Our interdisciplinary department's research is focusing on energy-related process and systems analyses. Data searches and system simulations are used to determine energy and mass balances, as well as to evaluate performance, emissions and costs of energy systems. The results are used for performing comparative assessment studies between the various systems. Our current priorities include the development of energy strategies, in accordance with the German Federal Government’s greenhouse gas reduction targets, by designing new infrastructures for sustainable and secure energy supply chains and by conducting cost analysis studies for integrating new technologies into future energy market frameworks.
