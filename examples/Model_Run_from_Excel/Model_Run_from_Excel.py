# # Using Excel for parameter input and model runs

# Besides using a python script or a jupyter notebook it is also possible to read and run a model using excel files.
#
# The energySystemModelRunFromExcel() function reads a model from excel, optimizes it and stores it to an excel file.
#
# The readEnergySystemModelFromExcel() function reads a model from excel.
#
# The model run can also be started on double-klicking on the run.bat Windows batch script in the folder where this notebook is located (still requires that a Python version, the FINE package and an optmization solver are installed).
#
# Moreover, it is possible to run the model inside the Excel file with a VBA Macro (see scenarioInputWithMacro.xlsx)

# %%
import FINE as fn 
# %load_ext autoreload
# %autoreload 2
