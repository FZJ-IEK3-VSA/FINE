# # Workflow for a multi-regional energy system
#
# In this application of the FINE framework, a multi-regional energy system is modeled and optimized.
#
# All classes which are available to the user are utilized and examples of the selection of different parameters within these classes are given.
#
# The workflow is structures as follows:
# 1. Required packages are imported and the input data path is set
# 2. An energy system model instance is created
# 3. Commodity sources are added to the energy system model
# 4. Commodity conversion components are added to the energy system model
# 5. Commodity storages are added to the energy system model
# 6. Commodity transmission components are added to the energy system model
# 7. Commodity sinks are added to the energy system model
# 8. The energy system model is optimized
# 9. Selected optimization results are presented
#

# 1. Import required packages and set input data path
