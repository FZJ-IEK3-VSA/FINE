  abstract = {Fossil-fueled heating in the building sector is responsible for 16 \% of Germany's total CO2 emissions. Options for the climate-neutral heating of buildings include renewable electricity or renewable hydrogen. In this paper, we conduct a bottom-up study to investigate the role of hydrogen in the climate-neutral energy supply of ten selected residential buildings in comparison to electricity-based systems. Based on a demand simulation and linear optimization of the supply system, sensitivity analyses identify the threshold values of the hydrogen price for the use of hydrogen technologies (hydrogen boilers or fuel cells) in building energy systems and make the quantities of hydrogen consumed visible. The results specify the first installations of hydrogen-operated fuel cells in multi-family houses if the hydrogen price reaches 0.17€/kWhH2 in 2050 at an electricity price of 0.31 €/kWhel. Generally, for different building types and electricity supply prices, it indicates that the use of hydrogen becomes economically-viable if the price of hydrogen supply is in the range of 34–61 \% of the price of the electricity supply per kWh and below. For the case of green hydrogen obtained using renewable electricity, it is highly questionable whether hydrogen supply will be that much cheaper than direct electricity supply, making its economical use in buildings uncertain.},

In our proposed algorithm, we solve a sequence of linear programs that serve to tighten a budget—the maximum amount we are willing to spend towards reducing overall costs. Our proposal finds application in the general setting where optional investment decisions provide an enhanced portfolio over the original setting that maintains feasibility. We present computational results on two model classes, and demonstrate computational savings up to 96\% on certain instances.},

	abstract = {Determining environmentally- and economically-optimal energy systems designs and operations is complex. In particular, the integration of weather-dependent renewable energy technologies into energy system optimization models presents new challenges to computational tractability that cannot only be solved by advancements in computational resources. In consequence, energy system modelers must tackle the complexity of their models by applying various methods to manipulate the underlying data and model structure, with the ultimate goal of finding optimal solutions. As which complexity reduction method is suitable for which research question is often unclear, herein we review different approaches for handling complexity. We first analyze the determinants of complexity and note that many drivers of complexity could be avoided a priori with a tailored model design. Second, we conduct a review of systematic complexity reduction methods for energy system optimization models, which can range from simple linearization performed by modelers to sophisticated multi-level approaches combining aggregation and decomposition methods. Based on this overview, we develop a guide for energy system modelers who encounter computational limitations.},

	abstract = {Modeling tools and technologies that will allow reaching decarbonization goals in the most cost-effective way are imperative for the transition to a climate-friendly energy system. This includes models which are able to optimize the design of energy systems with a large number of spatially distributed energy generation sources coupled with adequate short, medium, and long duration storage technologies. Solar photovoltaic and wind energy are likely to become the backbone in a future greenhouse gas neutral energy system and will require low-cost, geographically independent storage technologies in order to balance their intermittent availability. As an alternative to lithium-ion batteries and hydrogen systems, thermal energy storage coupled with a power block (e.g., Carnot batteries, pumped thermal storage, etc.) could be a promising option. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the influence of renewable generation profiles coupled with alternate storage options (i.e., Li-ion and hydrogen cavern) on the installed capacity of electric-to-thermal-to-electric systems using a 100\% renewable electricity system in Germany as a case study. The analyses reveal that Carnot batteries complement established and near-future storage technologies, as they could fill the gap between daily storage such as batteries and seasonal storage such as hydrogen salt caverns. Furthermore, Carnot Batteries could offer multiple options for heat integration further increasing their potential.},

      abstract     = {To reach the climate goals of the German government and the
                      associated reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the
                      future, the current energy system of Germany must undergo a
                      significant transformation towards a system based on
                      sustainable energy generation. The main subject of the
                      research is the evaluation of various options for achieving
                      these goals, ranging from the expansion of renewable
                      energies and the use of alternative energy sources to
                      efficiency measures in the consumer sectors. In contrast,
                      the significance of this change, taking into account the
                      regional characteristics and the necessity of energy
                      transport and the available storage options, is often
                      completely neglected in these studies. The aim of this work
                      is therefore the development of a spatially and temporally
                      highly resolved energy system optimization model for
                      Germany, which maps the geographical features of energy
                      generation and storage and takes into account the use of
                      sector coupling and the transport of the individual energy
                      sources. By coupling the model with the sectorally highly
                      resolved national energy system model, on the one hand, the
                      plausibility of the spatially unresolved results can be
                      checked and statements on the spatial level can be added. On
                      the other hand, the transformation path of the energy system
                      is taken into account without further increasing the model
                      complexity and thus the feasibility of the optimization
                      problem. The implementation of the model is based on the
                      open-source available framework FINE and complements it with
                      constraints to map supra-regional expansion targets. The
                      results are evaluated with a focus on the design and
                      utilization of grid-based transport infrastructures,
                      especially with a focus on the development of a hydrogen
                      infrastructure and the connection of offshore wind farms in
                      the short-term and long-term development of Germany’s
                      energy system. Here, the model and the applied methodology
                      of model coupling allow the consideration of an integrated
                      grid optimization. The results highlight the importance of
                      infrastructure development and the need for flexibility
                      options in order to be able to meet Germany´s energy
                      demands in the future and to achieve the greenhouse gas
                      reduction targets. In the short-term development until 2030,
                      natural gas-fired powerplants provide the necessary flexible
                      power generation outside of wind and solar hours and
                      substitute the more emission-intensive coal-fired power
                      generation. In the long-term development, a reduction of the
                      required storage capacities can only be achieved by
                      expanding the electricity grid. This will also allow for the
                      increased use of electricity provided offshore, that must be
                      transported from the north of the country to the south with
                      higher demand. Due to the decreasing importance of fossil
                      natural gas, the reassignment of the current gas transport
                      network as well as the gas storage facilities to hydrogen
                      transport and hydrogen storage is an economically and
                      sensible measure from a system point of view to achieve the
                      development of a hydrogen infrastructure quickly and at
                      optimal cost. However, these measures cannot prevent the
                      need for further expansion of the hydrogen infrastructure in

      abstract     = {Renewable energy sources are a crucial cornerstone in the
                      future energy sector to decelerate global warming and to
                      reach the international reduction targets for CO2 emissions.
                      However, the rising share of renewable energy sources
                      challenges the planning and operating of energy systems in
                      multiple regards: On the one hand, these sources are often
                      intermittent and in order to provide a safe energy supply,
                      energy storage technologies gain importance. On the other
                      hand, different energy sectors are progressively coupled
                      because the supply security can profit from the option to
                      exchange energy among different sectors. In order to
                      appropriately foresee these developments and derive
                      realistic de-signs of cost-efficient future energy systems,
                      spatiotemporally resolved energy system models have emerged
                      as a powerful tool. Yet, just as the real energy systems,
                      the models are becoming increasingly complex and the
                      consideration of intermittent renewable energy sources
                      require high temporal resolutions within these models.
                      Accordingly, energy system models are either limited in the
                      size of the regarded energy system, limited in the accuracy
                      or computation-ally simply intractable. Therefore, methods
                      were developed that strive to reduce the mathematical
                      complexity of energy system models without sacrificing too
                      much of the model’s accuracy. One of these methods is
                      temporal aggregation, i.e. the reduction of the number of
                      time steps considered by an energy system model in order to
                      capture transient changes of its operation schedule. This
                      thesis contributes to the research field of temporal
                      aggregation techniques for energy system modeling by
                      systematically comparing four fundamentally different energy
                      system models to each other, using a two-fold temporal
                      aggregation for efficiently decreasing the computational
                      burden of the regarded energy system models. Furthermore, it
                      introduces novel algorithms to increase the accuracy of
                      temporally aggregated energy system models significantly. In
                      contrast to prior works in the literature, this thesis does
                      not only assess the developed methods analytically, but also
                      stochastically with a wide variety of different temporal
                      aggregation configurations in order to take the differences
                      of the models into account. The results reveal that the
                      optimal temporal aggregation depends on two factors: The
                      existence of temporally coupling constraints in the model,
                      e.g. as introduced by storage technologies, and the types of
                      time series used as input to the models. Moreover, the
                      methods found in literature are outperformed consistently
                      and significantly by the methods proposed within this
                      thesis. All methods were generically implemented in the
                      Framework for Integrated Energy System Assessment (FINE) and
                      resulted in a fundamental restructuring and extension of the
                      time series aggregation module (tsam). The latter module is
                      a python-based out-of-the-box solution for temporal
                      aggregation techniques and is currently used by multiple
                      different energy system modeling frameworks.},

                      der anthropogenen Emissionen treibhausgasneutral

                      Treibhausgasemissionen erreicht werden. Im Vergleich zu den
                      vorherigen Regelungen schreibt das neue Gesetz eine
                      Verschärfung des Klimaschutzziels für das Jahr 2030 sowie
                      neuerdings jährliche Minderungsziele bis zum Jahr 2040
